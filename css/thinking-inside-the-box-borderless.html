<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>

<p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href>England</a> and its history can ba traced back for centuries,although they were re-invented in 1870's England,when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a href>Endlish estate gardens</a></p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs,along with some fruit trees.</p>
